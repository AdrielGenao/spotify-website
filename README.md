# spotify-website
Webpage (adrielgenao.pythonanywhere.com) that recommends songs based on your top-listened-to songs on Spotify, as well as providing information/analytics about your top songs, such as danceability and tempo. The site also features a search bar to provide the same features: analytics as well as recommended/similar songs. Utilizes Flask, the HTML files within the templates folder, and the Spotify API. The same test account (User: adrielgenao@yahoo.com Password: TestAccount1) can be used, but again any Spotify account can work.
Note - Website may load to a page from PythonAnywhere saying that the website is currently down/not functioning. Reload page a couple of times to go to the correct/main page for the site. I believe this has to do with the website not being used as much, so it is kept idle by PythonAnywhere.
# templates
Folder containing all HTML files for SpotifyWebsite.py
# static
