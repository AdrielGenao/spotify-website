# spotifyWebsite
Webpage (adrielgenao.pythonanywhere.com) that has the same function as Spotify.py program and more Spotify features and funcionality. Utilizes Flask, the HTML files within the templates folder, and the Spotify API. The same test account (User: adrielgenao@yahoo.com Password: TestAccount1) can be used, but again any Spotify account can work.
Note - Website may load to a page from PythonAnywhere saying that the website is currently down/not functioning. Reload page a couple of times to go to the correct/main page for the site. I believe this has to do with the website not being used as much, so it is kept idle by PythonAnywhere.
# templates
Folder containing all HTML files for SpotifyWebsite.py
# static
Folder for any static files for the website
